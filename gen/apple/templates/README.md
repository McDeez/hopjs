# Introduction

This project was automatically generated by HopJS (http://github.com/celer/hopjs) and contains a project for one of numerous Apple products.

HopJS can generate a native Mac OS X Cocoa Test App, IOS 6.0+ Test App or a Xcode framework project. Each of these projects uses two technologies to make this possible Google Gyp, which is a universal build tool and is used to generate the various XCode project files and a PodFile which manages the dependency upon AFNetworking. 

Both of the native test apps use a WebView to drive a Javascript test framework which is making native RESTful calls 

See the Installation steps below for more details. 

# Known Issues

 * Generation of the native IOS app sometimes results in an application that will compile and not run due an error finding the associated storyboard files, if this occurs simply remove the references to the storyboard files from XCode and re-add them.
