hopjs can't run the tests when they are hidden by the front end
pull in the changes to cjade
make cjade delay a little bit
hopjs needs to be able to use remote apis from other services
java code generator for hopjs
ruby code generator for hopjs
needs to apply a mutator to a bunch of API calls
self documenting mutators

api.requiresUser().noCache():

Fix erorr handling in hopjs-remote to look for error in responseHandlder first
Make it so that you can have multiple APIs loaded without conflict (i.e. detect versions and instantiate one per version!?!?)
Make it so you can send back a template
sub apis, aka fleet sub apis
hopjs-remote cannot upload files :(
leverage APIs from other services in the testing
make sure Hop.remoteAPI ... passes on the request session cookies?
